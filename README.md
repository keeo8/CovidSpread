# TRACKING COVID


## WHAT IS IT?

This is a pandemic model of how COVID-19 spreads around Middlebury Campus through students. This model assumes that students are wearing their masks when they are not eating. Tests are 100% accurate and let the student know within an hour of taking the test. Percentages for how viral covid is were taken from rough estimates based on real-world speculation. Equally, viral load is not taken into account in this model. 

## HOW IT WORKS
Students move through their schedule of the day and as they move around the day they may come into contact with infected students. They then become close-contacts and have a chance of developing symptoms. There is also testing and quarantining that dictates whether students will be separated from their peers if they have covid. 


## HOW TO USE IT

To use the model, first press setup. This will create the map and also create the students. Then press go and watch as students and covid spread around the map. 

There is a population slider that determines how many students there are. The isolation-on switch determines if students will be quarantined when they know they have covid. The testing-percentage slider lets you choose what percentage of students you would like to have tested. Testing frequency is a slider that determines how often you want students to be tested per week. 1 means students are tested every day and 7 means they are tested once per week. 

There is information on the right 

## THINGS TO TRY
Try to experience with isolation-on as well as how often students are tested. Quarantine has a strong effect on the model. 

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Some ways to extend the model would include allowing the option for masks to be off, or allowing the amount of students that start out with covid to change.

Students on Campus offered me insight on how they went about their days. The Middlebury Campus map came from https://www.middlebury.edu/system/files/media/middlebury%20campus%20map%202022.pdf. 
Ideas of the model were roughly based off of "High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of COVID-19 Spreading in a Small Town" by Truzkowska et al. "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adts.202000277 such as having specific areas designated definitely with different functions.
